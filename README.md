# 4.Execution_of_NetworkCommands
## AIM :Use of Network commands in Real Time environment
## Software : Command Prompt And Network Protocol Analyzer
## Procedure: To do this EXPERIMENT- follows these steps:

To do this experiment, follow these steps:

Students have to understand basic networking commands such as:

tcpdump
netstat
ifconfig
nslookup
traceroute
Additionally, capture ping and traceroute PDUs using a network protocol analyzer.

This includes all commands related to network configuration, such as:

Switching to privileged mode and normal mode
Configuring router interfaces
Saving the configuration to flash memory or permanent memory
This includes the following commands:
Configuring the router commands
General commands to configure network
Privileged mode commands of a router
Router processes & statistics
IP commands
Other IP commands (e.g., show ip route)

## Program
## Client.py
~~~
import socket

s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost', 8000))

while True:
    h = input("Enter the website you want to ping (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
    s.send(h.encode())
    if h == 'exit': break
    print(s.recv(4096).decode())

s.close()
~~~
## Server.py
~~~
import socket
from pythonping import ping

s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost', 8000))
s.listen(1)
c, _ = s.accept()

while True:
    h = c.recv(1024).decode()
    if h == 'exit': 
        print("Client disconnected.")
        break
    try: c.send(str(ping(h, count=4)).encode())
    except: c.send(b"Ping error")

c.close()
